Planned
- test.aldvmm.R: check the models really behave in the expected manner wrt messages, warnings and errors.
- Check number of iterations is returned by optimr/optimx
- Check all optimx::optimr() return values collected in output object.

Completed
- Email John C. Nash: Unused parameter error, why only starting value within limits, anyworkaround?
- aldvmm.init(): Add tests for initial values lying within bounds.
- Update detailed documentation of use of bounds and the behavior of aldvmm
- aldvmm(): modify feasibility test of initial values to stop when ll is larger than 1e+20 for optim.method L-BFGS-B
- Document rule of initial values outside limits in aldvmm.init(). Also mention optimx::bmchk() explicitely.
- Add test of aldvmm.init() for initial values outside limits behavior.
